# Task 2: Create a Guessing game.

In this program, i am going to write a code for building a number game where user have to guess the correct number.The number of guesses are tracked and finally on right guess the user can check how many rounds it took fo him to guess the right number.

## Technologies used: 

C++, game building.

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program i was able to learn many new things like:
1. Idea on how the interactive game play looks like.
2. The mathematical background of it.
3. Improve my coding knowledge.

# Task 5: Web Scraping.

In this task, I developed a web scraping program that extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file.

## Technologies used: 

Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, CSV

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program, I was able to learn many new things, such as:

1. Web Scraping Fundamentals: Gained a solid understanding of web scraping techniques and how to interact with web pages programmatically.
2. HTML Parsing: Learned how to parse and navigate HTML documents to extract specific data elements using BeautifulSoup.
3. HTTP Requests: Improved knowledge of making HTTP requests and handling responses using the requests library.
4. Data Storage: Learned how to structure and store extracted data in a CSV file for easy analysis and further use.
5. Ethical Considerations: Understood the importance of respecting website terms of service and ethical guidelines while scraping data.
